# Processing pipeline for an experiment with 3 visual stimuli
Run in the order as they are numbered, read the comments :)

A set of notebooks customized for an experiment with 3 visual stimuli : 2, 3, and 5 dots on the screen , separated by a blank screen.

Notebooks 01, 02, 03 do the preprocessing and take a pretty long time to run .. the rest of the notebooks produces nice plots and cell masks...
